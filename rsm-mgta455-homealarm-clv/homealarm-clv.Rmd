Prepare "Home Alarm, Inc.: Assessing Customer Lifetime Value" for class discussion and as an individual assignment and submit the assignment through GitLab. Be VERY clear about where results are coming from and what assumptions you are making in your R code. It is in your best interest that we do not have to struggle to figure out where your numbers came from. The assignment (pdf) is in the class Dropbox folder (week2/homealarm-ltv.pdf). Example R and Excel calculations are also on Dropbox (week1/readings).

## Setup

Create an rmarkdown document in which you calculate the CLV for a customers who uses auto-pay and for a customer that does not use auto-pay and answer question 1 through 4 in the assignment PDF.

## Hints

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Go to http://commonmark.org/help/ for a 10-minute interactive Markdown tutorial

When you click the **Knit** button in Rstudio, a document will be generated that includes both the text you type as well as the output of any embedded R-code chunks within the document.

## Analysis

The code chunk below sets the attrition notifications you should use in your analysis. 

```{r}
## Attrition notifications 
churn <- tibble::tibble(
  no_autopay = c(0,0.122, 0.162, 0.154, 0.134, 0.120,	0.111, 0.096),
  autopay =  c(0, 0.070, 0.097, 0.103, 0.095, 0.078, 0.069, 0.059),
  new_method =c(0,0, 0.097, 0.103, 0.095, 0.078, 0.069, 0.059)
)
residual_rate <- 1-churn
for (i in 2: length(residual_rate$autopay)){
  residual_rate$autopay[i]  = residual_rate$autopay[i]*residual_rate$autopay[i - 1]
}
for (i in 2: length(residual_rate$no_autopay)){
  residual_rate$no_autopay[i]  = residual_rate$no_autopay[i]*residual_rate$no_autopay[i - 1]
}
for (i in 2: length(residual_rate$new_method)){
  residual_rate$new_method[i]  = residual_rate$new_method[i]*residual_rate$new_method[i - 1]
}

annual_growth <- 0.03
annual_discount_rate <- 0.1
cost_service <- 0.15
marketing_cost <- 0.05
nr_years <- 8

time <- 1:nr_years
growth <- rep((1 + annual_growth)^(0:(nr_years-1)), each = 1)
revenues <- rep(480*(1+annual_growth), nr_years) * growth
service <- cost_service * revenues 
marketing <- marketing_cost * revenues
profit <- revenues - service - marketing

active_auto <- residual_rate$autopay
exp_profit_auto <- active_auto * profit
#because the fee is paid monthly,so when discount ,using time -0.5
PV_exp_profit_auto <- exp_profit_auto / (1 + annual_discount_rate)^(time-0.5)
CLV_auto <- cumsum(PV_exp_profit_auto)
AWS_auto <- tibble::tibble(time, CLV_auto)
radiant.data::visualize(AWS_auto, xvar = "time", yvar = "CLV_auto", type = "line", custom = TRUE)
print(AWS_auto)

active_nonauto <- residual_rate$no_autopay
exp_profit_nonauto <- active_nonauto * profit
PV_exp_profit_nonauto <- exp_profit_nonauto / (1 + annual_discount_rate)^(time-0.5)
CLV_nonauto <- cumsum(PV_exp_profit_nonauto)
AWS_nonauto <- tibble::tibble(time, CLV_nonauto)
radiant.data::visualize(AWS_nonauto, xvar = "time", yvar = "CLV_nonauto", type = "line", custom = TRUE)
print(AWS_nonauto)

active_new_method <- residual_rate$new_method
exp_profit_new_method <- active_new_method * profit
PV_exp_profit_new_method <- exp_profit_new_method / (1 + annual_discount_rate)^(time-0.5)
CLV_new_method <- cumsum(PV_exp_profit_new_method)
AWS_new_method <- tibble::tibble(time, CLV_new_method)
print(AWS_new_method)


```
So for nonauto,CLV is 1606.09(Question 2 ) and for auto,CLV is 1864.46(Question1)
For question 3,the maximum amount Home Alarm should spend on incentives to convert an
existing customer to auto-pay is 1864.46-1606.09 = 258.37

For question 4,I have three actions which individually make sense. 
Alternative marketing action 1 :For any customer make the decision to change to auto-pay this year,we give him a 200 dollars fees reduce in this year and the fees goes as usual after second year and the fees for the third year are based on fees which is not deducted in the second year
(As part of the validation ,a 200 dollars reduce come to a clv 1864.46- 200 =1664.46 in the final,consider the 200 reduce as marketing cost,only for second year)  

Action 2 :For any customer make the decision to change to auto-pay this year,we give him a half year fee free period(Actually reduce fees 247 dollars) in the future contact period.It means that customers can have any six months of the contract without payment.(As part of the validation ,the minimum clv is 1976-272=1704 >1606)  

Action 3 :For any customer decide to change to auto-pay this year and remain in the alarm service system,customer can choose one of the last five year(5-9 year) in the contact in the future to enjoy one year free service.(It means that if the customer want to use the free service ,in the second third,fourth and fifth year he will still pay for the service .For validation,suppose the customer use the free service in fifth year ,after changing the churn rate ,final clv is bigger than 1606)
